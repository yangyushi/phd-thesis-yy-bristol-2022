\chapter{Modelling the Zebrafish}

This chapter will introduce some computer simulation work for reproducing the observed experimental results. Computer simulation, altogether with theoretical calculation, experimental observation and democratic voting\marginfootnote{Jokingly, the existence of liquid--solid phase transition were put on a vote by George Uhlenbeck on a meeting in 1957 \cite{battimelli2018}.}, manifested itself as a powerful tool to answer questions about the nature of complex systems.

\section{Introduction}

In this section, different agent-based models will be discussed in order to mimic the observed behaviours of zebrafish. A simple model would capture the essence of the fish system, while a detailed model could re-create the behaviours of fish in very realistic way. A good and accurate model would give people extra insights about the fish, enabling the creation of theories to predict the behaviours of the systems under different conditions, just like one can predict the volume of ideal gas under different temperatures, knowing the corresponding equation of states.

Thanks to the development of the computer hardwares and the softwares, one can write a programming that simulate different type of models very easily. The simulation method for different models and details would be introduced in this chapter, and I will compare the simulation result with the experimental observations.
