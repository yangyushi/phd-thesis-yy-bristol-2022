\section{Introduction}

Understanding the behaviours of zebrafish is not only intellectually fulfilling, but it is also useful. Appreciating the stochastic nature of the animal behaviours, the detailed knowledge of zebrafish would enable us identify the behaviour differences. Let us take an example from soft matter physics. If I create two ensembles of Lennard--Jones liquid at the same density and temperature, and follow the movement of particles. Then I will get complete different trajectories. However, I would k
